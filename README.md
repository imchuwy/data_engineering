# Beginner ML Study Path

Self-paced notebooks organized by topic. Each folder has a curriculum notebook outlining goals and suggested exercises; add more notebooks as you work through the topics.

Modules
- 1. Pandas: data loading, cleaning, grouping, reshaping
- 2. Music: tiny decision tree example (existing)
- 3. Numpy: vectorized computing essentials
- 4. ScikitLearn: modeling pipelines and evaluation
- 5. Spark: distributed DataFrame operations and MLlib basics
- 6. SciPy: stats, optimization, and scientific routines
- a. VaRProject: finance data exploration and VaR prototype
- VibeCodeFrontEnd: UI prototype for VaR calculator

Tips
- Keep datasets small in this repo; use tmp paths for large files.
- Prefer reproducible cells: set seeds, fix versions in a requirements file if you add one.
- Commit checkpoints only when intentional; avoid saving huge outputs in notebooks.
