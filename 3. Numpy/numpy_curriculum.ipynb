        "# NumPy mini-curriculum\n",
        "## Goals\n",
        "- Create arrays from lists, ranges, random generators\n",
        "- Understand shapes, dtypes, broadcasting\n",
        "- Vectorized math, comparisons, boolean indexing\n",
        "- Reshape, stack, split; views vs copies\n",
        "- Aggregations (sum/mean/std) and axis concepts\n",
        "- Linear algebra: dot, matrix multiplication, norms, solve\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step-by-step path\n",
        "1. Setup and array creation\n",
        "   - Install numpy, set `import numpy as np` in notebooks.\n",
        "   - Build 1D/2D/3D arrays from lists, `np.array`, `np.arange`, `np.linspace`, random sampling.\n",
        "   - Inspect `.shape`, `.dtype`, `.ndim`, `.size`; explain why they matter.\n",
        "2. Slicing, indexing, and boolean masks\n",
        "   - Basic slices with start/stop/step on rows/cols; fancy indexing with lists of indices.\n",
        "   - Boolean masks and `np.where`; filter with conditions; combine masks with `&` and `|`.\n",
        "   - Views vs copies: mutate a slice and observe effects; use `.copy()` when needed.\n",
        "3. Broadcasting fundamentals\n",
        "   - Align shapes and dimensions; use `np.newaxis`/`None` to reshape for broadcasting.\n",
        "   - Normalize vectors/matrices by column/row; outer products; centering data.\n",
        "4. Vectorized math and comparisons\n",
        "   - Element-wise arithmetic, ufuncs, and reuse of masks to write branch-free code.\n",
        "   - `np.round`, `np.sqrt`, `np.exp`, `np.log`, clipping with `np.clip`.\n",
        "5. Reshaping and combining data\n",
        "   - `reshape`, `ravel`/`flatten`, `transpose`/`swapaxes` for rearranging dimensions.\n",
        "   - Stack and split: `hstack`, `vstack`, `concatenate`, `split`, `array_split`.\n",
        "6. Aggregations and axes\n",
        "   - Compute `sum`, `mean`, `std`, `min`, `max`, `argmin`, `argmax` across axes.\n",
        "   - Explain axis numbering; reduce over rows vs columns; keepdims to preserve shape.\n",
        "7. Linear algebra intro\n",
        "   - Matrix-vector and matrix-matrix products with `@` or `np.dot`.\n",
        "   - Norms (`np.linalg.norm`), solving linear systems (`np.linalg.solve`), determinants/eigenvalues (briefly).\n",
        "8. Performance and memory basics\n",
        "   - Compare vectorized code vs Python loops with `%timeit`.\n",
        "   - Explain contiguous memory, `astype` for dtype changes, and when to avoid copies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Suggested exercises\n",
        "- Build a 3x3 matrix and practice slicing rows/cols/steps; show the difference between a view and a copy.\n",
        "- Compute element-wise ops vs Python loops to compare speed using `%timeit`.\n",
        "- Use broadcasting to normalize columns of a matrix and verify each column now has mean 0 and std 1.\n",
        "- Write a small linear system and solve with `np.linalg.solve`; verify by multiplying back.\n",
        "- Take a random matrix, compute column-wise means, and subtract them using broadcasting.\n",
